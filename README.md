This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving an infinite loop within the useEffect hook. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation. The issue arises from attempting to update state within the useEffect hook's dependency array, which triggers a re-render and subsequently another state update, leading to an infinite loop.  The solution involves restructuring the logic to avoid modifying state directly within the useEffect's dependency array.
